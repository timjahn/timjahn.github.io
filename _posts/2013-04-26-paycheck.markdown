title: How did your first paycheck from your business affect you?
category: posts

Sixteen months ago, I received my first paycheck from <a href="http://entrepreneursunpluggd.com">Entrepreneurs Unpluggd</a>, the company I co-founded with my business partner <a href="http://startupstella.com">Stella Fayman</a> at the beginning of 2011. I can't believe that was 16 months ago. That paycheck is a part of my everyday life now.

Everyday life.

The conversation you have at dinner with your wife and kid. The fixing of the drainpipe hanging from the gutter outside your house that has been spilling water all over your back walk during every rainstorm this year. The beautiful spring days you spend outside enjoying every moment of. The barbeque you had all your friends over for.

That paycheck now helps support all of that.

There's something about a paycheck from your business affecting your everyday life that's so awesome and yet so scary at the same time. It's money that I worked to earn building something entirely from scratch. That's awesome. But it helps pay my mortgage and support my family, so I can't let it just disappear. That can be scary.
