title: Money IS everything
category: posts

People like to say things like "money isn't everything" and "money can't buy happiness" and "money is the root of all evil."

That may well be. But to them I say, "money makes the world go round."

Let me step back for a moment.

My goal in life is not to be a rich snob sitting on a yacht with a butler and brag about my ability to drop "hundos" whenever given the chance.

I love my family. I prefer a day spent with them playing outside over a day spent doing anything else.

But money influences the amount of time I spend with my family immensely.  On one extreme, if I had unlimited money, I could spend all my time with family.  On the other extreme, if I had very little money, I couldn't spend hardly any time with my family.

Money influences all the simple things in life too.  Health, for example.  Having money issues can stress a lot of people out.  The amount of money you have determines the amount of healthcare you can afford (in the United States, at least).

Most people spend a majority of their time every day working to make money.  The people that don't usually have money from some other source.  Maybe they inherited money, were gifted money, won the lottery, worked their butts off for years and sold a company, etc.

But everybody needs money. Money makes the world go round.  It's like the gas tank in your car.  When it's on full, you're fine.  You can go anywhere you want.

But when it's on empty, you're screwed.  You're not going anywhere.
